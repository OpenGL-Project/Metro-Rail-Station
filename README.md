# Metro-Rail-Station
The station is high from the ground. Beside the station, there will be a few high-rise buildings along with a river view on the front. Some random boats will be moving. The train will arrive and depart; the passengers will wait and walk when there is no train on the platform. There will also be a feature that will change the day/night cycle.
